Hi Viktor!

Great subject matter, I almost got myself a Martin a few years ago but ended up with a Gibson L2 reissue of a rosewood model from 1929. I'm getting the "need a new axe" feeking lately and I think I'll het a Martin this time.

Nice work! the site looks and works great, as you will see below there are only a few minor things I found.

The biggest issue is the coding style - you've got a Godkänt grade right now, but with the empty lines and indentation makes the code harder to read and is stopping me from assessing teh assignment as VG.

So: I would like you to fix up the things below and resubmit in order to get that VG grade. I don't think you have github set up, though - please o bevause yoou will need it for every other assignment,

It's your choice, if you are happy with the Godkänt grade, congratulations! If you want the VG let me know.

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

*************************************

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

3 separate pages: ✅

A header with a page title on every page: ✅ ❌
"Martin" doesn't have an h1 - google's SEO recommmends every page has one an onely one unique h1

A navigational menu every page with links to the other pages: ✅
Extremely well one on mobile

Contact form:
    Email: ✅
    Message:✅
    Required:✅
    Mail to:✅

RWD:
    Desktop:✅

External CSS: ✅

-------------------------------------

VÄLGODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

Current page indication in the menu: ❌
Add on 'active' class to the menu item of the current page to style it differently - an underline or somesuch 

Responsive Image: ✅

RWD:
  Media Query: ✅
  Flex/Grid: ✅

Separate CSS: ✅❌
While you have the separate pages, there is duplicated content in each stylesheet - eg the header and nav. A better approach is to separate these common eleements into their own file.
  Semantic: ✅

Semantic Element naming: ✅

Code Style:
  HTML: ❌ ✅
  Generally well done, but the indentation is a bit uneven and way too many empty lines. In html the open and closing tag should be at the same level of indentation, and everthing nside an element sould be inednted consistently.
  Html requires NO empty lines, you only need them for readability but for this assignment I would suggest not having any.
  Also on index and Martin the section with the header class exxentially contains all thhe content, its not breakng anything but a odd semantically 
  CSS: ✅ ❌
  The css is better, but again too many empty lines.
  With css you want one and just one empty line between each selector, and no empty lines inside a selector.

  Files and directories should always be lowercase.
